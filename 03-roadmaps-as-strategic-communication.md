# Roadmaps as Strategic Communication

## What a Roadmap Does

A product roadmap is a current, high-level explanation of how selected
initiatives may advance a strategy. It helps people understand:

- the outcomes being pursued;
- the problem areas receiving attention;
- why those areas matter now;
- the relationship between initiatives;
- the confidence and uncertainty around future work; and
- what is deliberately not being pursued.

GOV.UK guidance emphasizes that a roadmap should be easy to understand and easy
to adjust when priorities change. A roadmap is therefore both a decision record
and a communication tool, not a permanent contract.

## A Roadmap Is Not Every Planning Artifact

| Artifact | Appropriate detail | Main purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Product roadmap | Outcomes, themes, initiatives, horizons | Communicate strategy and direction |
| Release plan | Approved release scope, dependencies, target | Coordinate a bounded release |
| Delivery plan | Tasks, milestones, owners, sequencing | Coordinate execution |
| Backlog | Candidate and actionable work items | Manage discovery and delivery work |
| Gantt chart | Activities, dependencies, calendar dates | Plan predictable or constrained work |

A roadmap may link to these artifacts, but combining all of them creates a
document that is too detailed for strategic communication and too vague for
delivery management.

## Define Roadmap Initiatives

An initiative is a significant problem area or strategic direction that may
contain research, experiments, operational changes, and product changes. It is
larger than a user story but more actionable than a vision.

A strong initiative states:

- the opportunity or problem;
- the people affected;
- the objective and expected outcome;
- supporting evidence and confidence;
- important risks, constraints, and dependencies;
- what must be learned next;
- possible approaches without prematurely selecting one; and
- an outcome review signal.

Compare these two cards:

| Feature commitment | Outcome-oriented initiative |
|---|---|
| Build an AI support chatbot by Q3 | Reduce avoidable effort when customers seek routine support, while maintaining answer quality and safe escalation |

The second card leaves room to test search, content improvements, workflow
changes, guided forms, or an assistant. It also creates a basis for deciding
whether the initiative worked.

## Trace Each Initiative

    E[Evidence] --> P[Opportunity]
    P --> I[Initiative]
    I --> O[Objective]
    I --> R[Risk and dependencies]
    I --> L[Next learning]
    L --> D{Continue, adapt, or stop?}
```

An initiative without evidence is a hypothesis. An initiative without an
objective cannot demonstrate value. An initiative without a learning plan may
remain on the roadmap long after its assumptions fail.

## Roadmap Audiences

Different audiences need different views of the same underlying decisions:

- leadership needs strategic contribution, investment, risk, and confidence;
- product and delivery teams need problem context, dependencies, and learning;
- customer-facing teams need language they can use without promising features;
- governance groups need mandatory constraints, ownership, and review points;
- customers may need outcomes and direction without confidential detail.

Create views from one source of truth. Do not create separate roadmaps with
contradictory commitments.

## Check Your Understanding

1. Why is a roadmap not a delivery plan?
2. What makes an initiative different from a feature?
3. Why should one roadmap support several audience views?

1. It communicates strategic direction and uncertainty at a higher level; a
   delivery plan coordinates specific execution.
2. An initiative frames a problem and outcome and may contain several possible
   solutions, experiments, or operational changes.
3. Different audiences need different detail, but contradictory source
   roadmaps create confusion and accidental promises.
